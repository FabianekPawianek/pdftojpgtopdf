\#pdftojpgtopdf



I was forced to use Archicad pdfs, so I mada this `.bat` to make them a bit less terrible. 



Simple Windows batch script that flattens PDF files by converting them to images and back to PDF. Useful for reducing file size or merging layers.



\## Requirements

\- Windows 10/11

\- \[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)

\- \[Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/)



\## Quick Start

1\. Download this repository.

2\. Run `setup.bat` to install dependencies automatically.

3\. \*\*Restart your computer\*\* or not.

4\. Run `pdftojpgtopdf.bat`.



\## Usage

1\. Drag and drop PDF files into the console window.

2\. Set DPI (e.g., 150) and JPEG Quality (e.g., 80).

3\. The script creates a new rasterized PDF in the same folder.
